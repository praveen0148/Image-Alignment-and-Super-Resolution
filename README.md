# Image-Alignment-and-Super-Resolution
Enhancing mobile images to DSLR quality using image alignment and Real-ESRGAN

# Image Alignment and Super-Resolution Project

This project aims to bridge the quality gap between low-resolution images captured by mobile phones and high-resolution images taken by DSLR cameras. By leveraging advanced image alignment and super-resolution techniques, weâ€™ve achieved a level of detail and clarity that was previously unattainable for everyday devices.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Enhance low-resolution images to match the quality of high-resolution DSLR images.
- **Motive**: Close the gap between mobile and professional photography, making high-end image quality accessible on everyday devices.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: OpenCV, Real-ESRGAN, PyTorch
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git
